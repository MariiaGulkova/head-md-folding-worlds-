## Pitch 2023-05-17

You open your eyes in a room with some scary trashed puppets. There is a dark broken mirror on the wall.  and see a hole inside the wall. You go inside the hole and find yourself in a black and white forest with dead puppets hanged around. You see a shadow coming toward you. If it touches you, you begin again from the room. If you escape from it and hide, it just passes. You are stuck in this forest and cannot get out of it. The only way to go out of this world is to go through the shadow. You do it and you find yourself in the room again. You can see yourself in  a mirror. You are also a puppet.
