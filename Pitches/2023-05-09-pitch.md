## Pitch 2023-05-09

 The story is about travelling in Ukrain and Iran's culture by means of a flying carpet, giving a chance to explore different worlds. The maquette (our world) is inspired by an Iranian object (city of foreigners), which is a box with holes. Each hole has a new world inside that you can go through and explore new horror surrealistic worlds.
