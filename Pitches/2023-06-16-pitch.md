We find ourselves in a frightful, dark realm, filled with scary sounds and a raspy breath. We see a mirror obscured by shadows.  Exploring the gloomy trees, lifeless puppets, and creepy human-faced stones, we see a shadow. The shadow is walking around a light to protect it. Grasping the light, we illuminate each object, transforming them into radiant beauty. We can turn things bright one after one, and they stay bright. Once we lit the world, it is not a scary world as we thought. However the sound becomes euphonious, we still hear the raspy breath. As we gaze into the mirror again, a horrifying monster stares back, a reminder of the darkness and fear within ourselves which somehow is not real.
