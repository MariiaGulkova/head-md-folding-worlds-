### Shades of Metamorphosis

### Pitch

You open your eyes in a room with some scary trashed puppets. There is a dark broken mirror on the wall. A hole appears inside the wall. You go inside the hole and find yourself in a forest with dead puppets hanged around. A shadow comes toward you. A sound whispers in your ears: “Hide”. You try to hide while you see scary trees and monstrous-faced stones on the ground. You are stuck here and cannot get out of it. The only way to go out is to go through the shadow. You do it and you find yourself in the room again. The room is more bright and the scary puppets seem to be cute under the colored lights. The mirror is not dark anymore. You look at the mirror and see a monstrous puppet.

### Visual Interaction Loop

Our main interaction at the moment is contact with the shadow by touching. The second interaction is hiding from the shadow and avoiding touching. Touching the Shadow, you see yourself where you startedin the room again.
