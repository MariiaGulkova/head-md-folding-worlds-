After meeting with Camille and Douglas, we simplified the scenario of our project. Now the user appears in a dark forest with a minimum of light, he hears frightening sounds, but the loudest is heavy panting (like a zombie). The user sees a road in front of him and begins to move along it, studying this terrible and scary world (the terrifying breathing does not stop, it pursues him). After a while, he sees a shadow above his head, which is lit by light. He takes this light and looks around, and realizes that the world is changing and it is not as scary as he thought, everything is nice and bright. And then a mirror appears in which the user sees himself - he is a monster, and the labored breathing belongs to him

Considering this, some aspects was changing:

#### Models

- Mirror
- trees
- monstrous stones

#### Gestures
- Take a light

#### Sounds
- strange breath 
- footstep sounds
- the sounds of the dying

### State Machines

#### World
