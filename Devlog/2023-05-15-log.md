### Plan for our storyboard 

- We are in a room full of trashed and ugly dolls.
- We see a broken mirror and see that we are a doll too. 
- We see a carpet moving on the ground with a wooden stick and a skeleton head which is lighting. 
- When we stand on the carpet, it flies. We can fly with the light in our hands. 
- Flying high, we go through a hole in the wall, finding ourselves in a surrealistic horror world. It is dark world 
- First shadow Hiding from it
- Second shadow Hiding from it
- Third Shadow Hiding from it
- Biggest shadow
- Closed Door
- Turn on light
- Small Dolls
